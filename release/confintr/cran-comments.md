## Resubmission of initial submission

Fixed the following tasks by Martina Schmirl:

1. explained acronyms:
   - "IQR" -> "interquartile range (IQR)"
   - "MAD" -> "median absolute deviation (MAD)"
   
2. Fixed reference in description to "... are described in Smithson, M. (2003, ISBN: 978-0761924999)."

Furthemore, the docu has slightly been improved as well as the function "ci_cramersv".
